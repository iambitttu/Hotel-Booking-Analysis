# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Introduction
The Hotel Booking Analysis project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to gain insights into customer reservations and improve customer experience and sales strategies. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques, we aim to identify patterns and trends in the data to make informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains hotel booking information, including details such as reservation status, hotel type (city or resort), customer demographics, and booking rates. It provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior and hotel performance.

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this analysis are as follows:

1. **Identify Reservation Status**: Analyze the reservation status in different hotels to understand the percentage of bookings that were confirmed, canceled, or no-shows. This information will help in optimizing the booking process and improving customer satisfaction.

2. **Top 10 Countries with Reservation Cancellations**: Determine the top 10 countries from which reservations were canceled. This insight will assist in identifying any potential issues or trends related to specific countries and develop targeted strategies to reduce cancellations.

3. **Average Daily Rate in City and Resort Hotels**: Calculate and compare the average daily rates for city and resort hotels. This analysis will provide valuable information for pricing strategies, demand forecasting, and understanding market segments.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading**: Load the hotel booking dataset into the code using pandas library. Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and content of the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates if any, and perform necessary data transformations. This step ensures the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to explore the dataset. Analyze different variables, their distributions, and relationships. Generate various visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots to uncover patterns and trends.

4. **Reservation Status Analysis**: Calculate the percentage of confirmed, canceled, and no-show reservations in different hotels. Visualize the results using pie charts or bar plots to highlight the distribution.

5. **Top 10 Countries with Reservation Cancellations**: Identify the countries with the highest number of reservation cancellations. Utilize bar plots or heatmaps to visualize the cancellation rates for each country.

6. **Average Daily Rate Analysis**: Calculate the average daily rates for city and resort hotels. Compare the rates using box plots or bar plots to understand the pricing differences and identify potential market segments.

7. **Documentation**: Prepare a comprehensive documentation summarizing the steps involved in the analysis, along with the findings and insights obtained. Include visualizations and interpretations to effectively communicate the results.

## Conclusion
The Hotel Booking Analysis project aims to improve customer experience and sales strategies by analyzing hotel booking data. By performing exploratory data analysis and visualization, we can gain insights into reservation statuses, top countries with cancellations, and average daily rates for city and resort hotels. These insights will help optimize the booking process, identify areas for improvement, and plan pricing and sales strategies to maximize customer satisfaction and revenue.
